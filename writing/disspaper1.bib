Proper concept mapping methods include all methods of knowledge graphic presentation that are clearly based on the seminal writings of Novak and his research group from 1981 to 2002. Some writers may use the term concept mapping, although one of the most basic requirements is not fulfilled: No meaningful propositions are produced out of linked concepts. Sometimes no links at all are present, only concepts spread in a conceptual space. In “the Novakian Standard Concept Mapping Format” there are some unnecessarily complex rules. Critical reflection on alternative ideas about concept mapping may suggest alternative and better ideas in the future.},

  abstract = {Is it possible to teach biology without mentioning evolution? The answer is yes, but it is not possible for students to understand biology without the evolutionary context on which the meaning and intellectual value of biological concepts depend. Meaningful learning of evolution requires (1) that the students incorporate new knowledge into a cognitive structure linked with higher-order concepts; (2) a well-organized knowledge structure; and (3) a positive emotional attachment and identification (affective commitment) to the subject by the learner. Concept maps are useful tools in meaningful learning. We present a concept map that organizes concepts of history of life and the processes that generate it, and the hierarchical relationships among them. Biological evolution is a compelling account of life on Earth and of human origins. It constitutes a unifying explanatory framework that can generate a powerful affective commitment to the subject. The concept map provided here is tied to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).},

We included studies measuring students’ critical thinking through standardised tests, comparing an experimental (concept mapping) group with a control (traditional teaching) one. Effect sizes for critical thinking ability and disposition outcomes were pooled with a randomeffects model. We included in our meta-analysis 21 studies (108 comparisons) involving 1695 students. The concept mapping method was more effective than the traditional teaching method at posttest for the improvement of critical thinking ability (g = 0.531, 95\% CI 0.279 to 0.783) and disposition (g = 0.648, 95\% CI 0.266 to 1.031). Heterogeneity was moderate to high, Egger’s test did not indicate any evidence of publication bias; however, both visual inspection of the Funnel plot and Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method indicated potentially three missing studies for critical thinking ability and two for critical thinking disposition. Additionally, we analysed the potential moderating effect of students’ demographic characteristics, educational conditions, concept mapping elaboration methods and allocation type. Allocation type was a significant moderator, having a strong effect on concept mapping for critical thinking abilities in randomised studies (g = 0.739, 95\% CI 0.356 to 1.122), but its effect is low in non-randomised studies (g = 0.265, 95\% CI 0.014 to 0.517).},

  abstract = {Students typically create concept maps while they view the material they are trying to learn. In these circumstances, concept mapping serves as an elaborative study activity—students are not required to retrieve the material they are learning. In 2 experiments, we examined the effectiveness of concept mapping when it is used as a retrieval practice activity. In Experiment 1, students read educational texts and practiced retrieval either by writing down as many ideas as they could recall in paragraph format or by creating a concept map (retrieval-based concept mapping). In Experiment 2, we factorially crossed the format of the activity (paragraph vs. concept map) and the presence or absence of the text (i.e., whether the activity involved repeated studying or retrieval practice). On a final test 1 week later that assessed verbatim knowledge and inferencing, both paragraph and concept map retrieval practice formats produced better performance than additional studying, but the 2 retrieval formats themselves did not differ. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of concept mapping when it is used as a retrieval practice activity and show that retrieval itself, rather than merely the act of writing, drives the benefits of retrieval-based learning activities.},

  abstract = {Background: Example-based learning using worked examples can foster clinical reasoning. Worked examples are instructional tools that learners can use to study the steps needed to solve a problem. Studying worked examples paired with completion examples promotes acquisition of problem-solving skills more than studying worked examples alone. Completion examples are worked examples in which some of the solution steps remain unsolved for learners to complete. Providing learners engaged in example-based learning with self-explanation prompts has been shown to foster increased meaningful learning compared to providing no self-explanation prompts. Concept mapping and concept map study are other instructional activities known to promote meaningful learning. This study compares the effects of self-explaining, completing a concept map and studying a concept map on conceptual knowledge and problem-solving skills among novice learners engaged in example-based learning. Methods: Ninety-one physiotherapy students were randomized into three conditions. They performed a pre-test and a post-test to evaluate their gains in conceptual knowledge and problem-solving skills (transfer performance) in intervention selection. They studied three pairs of worked/completion examples in a digital learning environment. Worked examples consisted of a written reasoning process for selecting an optimal physiotherapy intervention for a patient. The completion examples were partially worked out, with the last few problem-solving steps left blank for students to complete. The students then had to engage in additional self-explanation, concept map completion or model concept map study in order to synthesize and deepen their knowledge of the key concepts and problem-solving steps. Results: Pre-test performance did not differ among conditions. Post-test conceptual knowledge was higher (P {$<$} .001) in the concept map study condition (68.8 ± 21.8\%) compared to the concept map completion (52.8 ± 17.0\%) and self-explanation (52.2 ± 21.7\%) conditions. Post-test problem-solving performance was higher (P {$<$} .05) in the self-explanation (63.2 ± 16.0\%) condition compared to the concept map study (53.3 ± 16.4\%) and concept map completion (51.0 ± 13.6\%) conditions. Students in the self-explanation condition also invested less mental effort in the post-test. Conclusions: Studying model concept maps led to greater conceptual knowledge, whereas self-explanation led to higher transfer performance. Self-explanation and concept map study can be combined with worked example and completion example strategies to foster intervention selection.},

Therefore, the analysis includes experimental studies conducted in Turkey between 2000 and 2015 which compare the concept mapping instructional strategy and the traditional method. 216 master’s and doctoral theses and 114 articles were found on the topic. Among these, 73 studies were selected which met the inclusion criteria. These were then combined through meta-analysis. At the end of the study, the concept mapping instructional strategy has been determined to have a significantly positive effect on the Turkish students' academic success (ES=1,119; p{$<$}0,05). Considering the population of Turkey, the findings indicate that the effect of concept mapping instructional strategy in terms of academic success was higher than traditional method.},

For example, hierarchical relationships among structures and steps within processes are two common kinds of relationships that students encounter regularly.

A greater consideration of the context for learning provides alternatives to some of the assumptions that underpin the disciplinespecific concept mapping literature. The methodological shortcomings in the literature on concept mapping revealed by earlier reviews are reevaluated to support reflection on how the tool may be profitably used and also how such reviews may be conducted to better inform practice.

  abstract = {Concept maps (Cmaps) are still underutilized in adult literacy programs and classes. The teaching and learning approaches that have been used historically in adult literacy programs to address the learning needs of these students have not kept pace with the literacy skill demands that have sprung from the increased pace of technological innovation. This study investigated published reports of empirical research studies that have tested the effects of Cmaps on the achievement ability of a wide variety of learners. The literature review included 55 refereed journal articles. Our findings provide useful information for adult literacy practitioners interested in utilizing concept mapping as an approach to teaching and learning in their classes.},

Following an exhaustive search for studies meeting specified design criteria, 67 standardized mean difference effect sizes were extracted from 55 studies involving 5,818 participants. Students at levels ranging from Grade 4 to postsecondary used concept maps to learn in domains such as science, psychology, statistics, and nursing. Posttests measured recall and transfer. Across several instructional conditions, settings, and methodological features, the use of concept maps was associated with increased knowledge retention. Mean effect sizes varied from small to large depending on how concept maps were used and on the type of comparison treatment. Significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets.},

We investigated how using concept maps influences learning by synthesizing the results of 142 independent effect sizes (n = 11,814). A random-effects model meta-analysis revealed that learning with concept and knowledge maps produced a moderate, statistically significant effect (g = 0.58, p {$<$} 0.001). A moderator analysis revealed that creating concept maps (g = 0.72, p {$<$} 0.001) was associated with greater benefit relative to respective comparison conditions than studying concept maps (g = 0.43, p {$<$} 0.001). Additional moderator analyses indicated learning with concept maps was superior to other instructional comparison conditions, and was effective across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and non-STEM knowledge domains. Further moderator analyses, as well as implications for theory and practice, are provided.},

The design emphasized external validity. As hypothesized, concept mapping facilitated lowability learners' performance, but only on higher level, relational knowledge. The usefulness of the technique was discussed in terms of its ability to individualize and raise the quality of learning with little extra effort or resource costs to the instructional system.},

Eighty-two eighth-grade students in four science classes participated in this study. The experimental group completed the concept map at the beginning of the science unit under the teacher’s supervision. At the end of the twoweek unit a science test was administered to the experimental and the control group. The results of a one-tailed t test indicated that there was a significant difference between the two groups. The effect size is 0.40. It appears that the concept map can provide the classroom teachers with a meaningful and practical structured approach for using advance organizers in their classes.},

Students (N = 91) who enrolled in an elementary science methods course were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Subjects in both groups were administered a multiple-choicelfree-response inventory which assayed their knowledge of “Life Zones in the Ocean,” and then were asked to construct a concept map on the same topic. Those in the experimental group subsequently received 45 minutes of computerassisted instruction on marine life zones, while those in the control (“placebo”) group received an equivalent exposure to an unrelated topic (‘‘Body Defenses”). Upon completing the instructional sequence, subjects were again administered the “Life Zones” inventory and asked to develop a postinstruction concept map on marine life zones. The data analysis employed a split plot factorial design with repeated measures. Differences among treatment groups were documented by analysis of variance and chi-square procedures. Subjects in the experimental group showed evidence of significant and substantial changes in the complexity and propositional structure of the knowledge base, as revealed in concept maps. No such changes were found in the control group. Results suggest that concept mapping offers a valid and potentially useful technique for documenting and exploring conceptual change in biology.},

  abstract = {Objectives: As an essential skill in daily clinical nursing practice, critical thinking ability has been an important objective in nursing education. Concept mapping enables nursing students connect new information to existing knowledge and integrates interdisciplinary knowledge. However, there is a lack of evidence related to critical thinking ability and concept mapping in nursing education. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effect of concept mapping in developing critical thinking in nursing education. Design: This systematic review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data sources: A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing concept mapping and traditional teaching method were retrieved. Review methods: Data were collected by two reviewers according to the data extraction tables. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by other two reviewers. The results of meta-analysis were presented using mean difference (MD). Result: Thirteen trials were summarized in the systematic review and eleven trials were included in the metaanalysis. The pooled effect size showed that, comparing with traditional methods, concept mapping could improve subjects' critical thinking ability measured by California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), California Critical Thinking Skill Test (CCTST) and Critical Thinking Scale (CTS). The subgroup analyses showed that concept mapping improved the score of all subscales. Conclusion: The result of this review indicated that concept mapping could affect the critical thinking affective dispositions and critical thinking cognitive skills. Further high quality research using uniform evaluation is required.},
