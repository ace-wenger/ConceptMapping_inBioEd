  abstract = {The present study conducted to investigate the contribution of conceptual change texts, accompanied by concept mapping instruction to eleventh-grade students’ understanding of cellular respiration concepts, and their retention of this understanding. Cellular respiration concepts test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students’ difficulties. The test was administrated as pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test to a total of 70 eleventh-grade students in two classes of the same high school in an urban area, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group was a class of 34 students who received conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction. A class of 36 students comprised the control group who received traditional instruction. Besides treatment, previous understanding and logical thinking ability were other independent variables involved in this study. The results showed that logical thinking, treatment, previous understanding of cellular respiration concepts each made a statistically significant contribution to the variation in students’ understanding of cellular respiration concepts. The result also showed that conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction was significantly better than traditional instruction in retention of this understanding.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the achievement of students taught with concept mapping, cooperative learning, 5E learning cycle and lecture methods with the intention of identifying which one among them could be most suitable for teaching Biology. To guide this study, four research questions were raised and tested at 0.05level of significance. The design of the study was pre-test, post-test, delayed post-test, quasi experimental repeated measures design. The samples of the study consisted of four mixed secondary schools, 259 students and eight Biology teachers. The major findings of the study include: significant effect of the four instructional methods on achievement and retention; students in the 5E learning cycle and cooperative leaning groups significantly outscored those in the concept mapping and lecture groups on achievement and retention tests; students in concept mapping outscored those in lecture group both on immediate achievement and retention tests; students in 5E learning cycle and cooperative learning groups did not significantly differ on achievement and retention tests; males and females in all the four groups did not significantly differ on the achievement tests; and a non-significant interaction effect between sex and method of instruction on achievement. It was concluded that the adoption of either 5E learning cycle or cooperative learning strategies may be appropriate for the teaching and learning of Biology.},

The present study was conducted as an experimental study with pre-test and post-test control groups. The participants of the study were impartially chosen 11th grade high school students from an Anatolian High School and a Teacher Training Anatolian High School. 45 students, 21 in the control and 24 in the experimental group, participated in the study. In the present study, ‘urinary system’ unit was taught. Whereas the control group was taught traditionally, the experimental group was taught using concept map based teaching technique. Data was collected using concept map attitude scale and biology achievement test, a 45 item scale with a reliability coefficient of (α = .78). In order to identify the differences among the groups, biology achievement test was used as pre and post test. Data obtained to determine the achievement of both groups were analyzed using t-test analysis model of the SPSS 11.0 package program. At the end of the study, a statistically significant difference (p{$<$}.05) between emerged traditional teaching method and using concept map while teaching. The data also indicated that the cognitive support of the concept maps had a positive impact on students’ achievement and retention of knowledge. The data furthermore indicated that students have a positive attitude for concept maps.},

  abstract = {Concept mapping and retrieval practice are both educational methods that have separately been reported to provide significant benefits for learning in diverse settings. Concept mapping involves diagramming a hierarchical representation of relationships between distinct pieces of information, whereas retrieval practice involves retrieving information that was previously coded into memory. The relative benefits of these two methods have never been tested against each other in a classroom setting. Our study was designed to investigate whether or not concept mapping or retrieval practice produced a significant learning benefit in an undergraduate physiology course as measured by exam performance and, if so, was the benefit of one method significantly greater than the other. We found that there was a trend toward increased exam scores for the retrieval practice group compared with both the control group and concept mapping group, and that trend achieved statistical significance for one of the four module exams in the course. We also found that women performed statistically better than men on the module exam that contained a substantial amount of material relating to female reproductive physiology.},

  abstract = {Background: Example-based learning using worked examples can foster clinical reasoning. Worked examples are instructional tools that learners can use to study the steps needed to solve a problem. Studying worked examples paired with completion examples promotes acquisition of problem-solving skills more than studying worked examples alone. Completion examples are worked examples in which some of the solution steps remain unsolved for learners to complete. Providing learners engaged in example-based learning with self-explanation prompts has been shown to foster increased meaningful learning compared to providing no self-explanation prompts. Concept mapping and concept map study are other instructional activities known to promote meaningful learning. This study compares the effects of self-explaining, completing a concept map and studying a concept map on conceptual knowledge and problem-solving skills among novice learners engaged in example-based learning. Methods: Ninety-one physiotherapy students were randomized into three conditions. They performed a pre-test and a post-test to evaluate their gains in conceptual knowledge and problem-solving skills (transfer performance) in intervention selection. They studied three pairs of worked/completion examples in a digital learning environment. Worked examples consisted of a written reasoning process for selecting an optimal physiotherapy intervention for a patient. The completion examples were partially worked out, with the last few problem-solving steps left blank for students to complete. The students then had to engage in additional self-explanation, concept map completion or model concept map study in order to synthesize and deepen their knowledge of the key concepts and problem-solving steps. Results: Pre-test performance did not differ among conditions. Post-test conceptual knowledge was higher (P {$<$} .001) in the concept map study condition (68.8 ± 21.8\%) compared to the concept map completion (52.8 ± 17.0\%) and self-explanation (52.2 ± 21.7\%) conditions. Post-test problem-solving performance was higher (P {$<$} .05) in the self-explanation (63.2 ± 16.0\%) condition compared to the concept map study (53.3 ± 16.4\%) and concept map completion (51.0 ± 13.6\%) conditions. Students in the self-explanation condition also invested less mental effort in the post-test. Conclusions: Studying model concept maps led to greater conceptual knowledge, whereas self-explanation led to higher transfer performance. Self-explanation and concept map study can be combined with worked example and completion example strategies to foster intervention selection.},

One group was taught by a readand-discuss, teacher-directed method, and the second group, given the same type of introductory lesson as the first, followed a model of concept mapping that connected major and minor concept ideas. A criterion-referenced test based on the content of a science chapter served as the dependent variable. Prior to any teaching, a pretest was administered. An analysis of covariance with pretest scores as the covariate showed a statistically significant difference in comprehension between the pretest and posttest for the experimental group. Effect size estimates revealed that concept mapping can be expected to improve comprehension scores of low-achieving seventh graders by approximately six standard deviations over a traditional instructional technique. When students lack background information on a topic to aid comprehension, the active participation in constructing semantic or concept maps may help students form a cognitive schema to assimilate and relate the new topic information.},

This study evaluated the impact of articulating the concept map strategy with the mediated learning experience on meaningful learning during the cardiovascular module of a medical physiology course at Universidad Autónoma de Bucaramanga. This research was based on the ideas of David Ausubel (meaningful learning), Joseph Novak (concept maps), and Reuven Feuerstein (mediated learning experience). Students were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (mediated learning experience articulated with concept mapping) or a control group (traditional methodology). The intervention group constructed concept maps related to cardiovascular physiology and used them to solve problems related to this subject. The control group attended traditional discussion sessions and problem-solving sessions. All students were evaluated with two types of exams: problem-solving and multiple-choice exams. The intervention group performed significantly better on the problem-solving exams, but the difference was not significant in the multiple-choice exam. It was concluded that intervention promoted meaningful learning that allowed the students to transfer this knowledge to solve problems. The implemented strategy had a greater impact on the students who came into the study with the lowest cognitive competence, possibly because they were empowered by the intervention.},

  abstract = {Concept mapping (CM) and Gowin's Vee (V) mapping strategies were used with two high school freshmen biology classes for two semesters. A quasi experimental case study design was used because all variables could not be controlled in a field situation. The effect of these instructional strategies was assessed in terms of test performance, attitude change, laboratory understanding, anecdotal records, and clinical interviews. The experimental group received CM and Vee strategies and two comparison classes received traditional instructional strategies of textbook questions and laboratory manual questions (TQ/LQ). Taped clinical interviews revealed that CM/V students thought the CM/V strategies were 'hard work'. They also indicated that students recognized and valued understanding vs. rote learning whereas TQ/LQ students did not make this distinction. Vee instructed students demonstrated an understanding that interrelationships existed between theory and method, ideas and observations, and cognitively connected laboratory activities to text information and class discussions. Students in comparison classes did not state these interrelationships in particular essay test items and in oral responses to an independent laboratory observer. Objective test performance between the two groups was not significantly different, but quality of essay answers was markedly better in the CM/V students. Attitude toward biology was different between the two groups in their interviews. Although the CM/V students did not like to work hard, as CMs and Vees demanded, they did comment that biology really made sense for them. Some students were seen to have fear of new strategies. Based on the results of the interviews, a link between learning theory and teaching can be made by CM/V strategies. Junior animal behavior students and students in science fair research were seen to use Vees to clarify their understanding of original journal research papers and to represent their own research to judges at science fairs in lieu of the abstract. This research can be translated into practice. There is a need to help people learn about science concepts, facts, and events. CM/V strategies should be performed by students within 2-4 different disciplines per their school day, over 2-3 years for a more realistic assessment of the effects of "learning to learn" strategies on attitudes, achievement and performance.},

Yet less is known about the necessity of scaffolding for competent students reading unfamiliar content. To explore that question, we investigated the effects of two knowledge scaffolding techniques (i.e., mobilization and concept mapping) versus control on undergraduates’ comprehension overall and by question type. The 118 undergraduates were randomly assigned to a condition and read a text about cellular biology. Results indicated a significant effect of scaffolding on students’ comprehension after controlling for prior knowledge. Follow-up analyses for overall comprehension demonstrated that the concept mapping group outperformed the mobilization and control groups, and the mobilization group outperformed the control group. These results suggest that competent readers benefit from scaffolding when reading unfamiliar content.},

Findings support the stand that concept mapping is significantly more effective than the traditional/expository teaching strategy in enhancing learning in biology.

The project sought to assess the effects on achievement of the use of these two heuristics as part of a carefully designed sequence of instruction. Two instructional treatments were compared, one that utilized the two experimental heuristics as study aids and one that utilized outlining as a comparison study aid. The instructional treatments were administered over approximately a one semester period. Two hundred and fifty subjects, nearly all black, from two urban high schools in Indiana took part in the study. Achievement instruments designed to measure meaningful (higher order) learning were developed. Analysis of variance of the achievement test means failed to reveal statistically significant differences between the experimental and comparison treatment at the 0.05 alpha level. However, there were suggestions of a tendency toward an effect of the experimental treatment, and several factors contributing to the difficulty in distinguishing achievement differences were identified.},

  abstract = {Teaching biology is characterized by a great number of concepts and facts. It is very difficult to concisely represent all important concepts and facts. In order to effectively present important concepts such as pollination and pollinators, concept maps have been applied. In particular, the pedagogical experiment was applied to determine whether the concept maps are effective as teaching technology compared to the usual teaching approach without this technology. The research involved 110 elementary school students who were divided into one experimental (E) and one control (C) group. The E group covered programme content related to pollination and pollinators by applying concept maps. The C group was exposed to the same content, without these maps. It is evidenced a difference of the attained knowledge in favour of the experimental group after the introduction of the experimental factor (application of concept maps). The application of concept maps directly contributed to better learning and knowledge acquisition in teaching the biology content Pollination and Pollinators. Based upon the obtained results of this research, concept maps will be further implemented to improve teaching process and the teachers will be gradually trained for the application of this teaching technology.},

  abstract = {Background: The objective of this study was to compare concept mapping with lecture-based method in teaching of evidence based educated topic to medical students. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was carried out on medical students during sixth year of 7-year MD curriculum clerkship phase. Cluster randomization was used to divide students into intervention and control groups. Both groups, at the beginning, were taught “Diabetic Ketoacidosis” (DKA) using evidence-based tool named Critically Appraised Topics (CAT). Students of intervention group were taught construction of concept maps on DKA and in the control group students had a lecture and a group discussion about what they had been taught on DKA. In the end, all of the students had an exam that they had to answer to 7 questions following to two clinical scenarios. The questions addressed physiopathology, diagnosis and treatment of patients with DKA and were scored separately. Sum of these scores was considered as total score. Scores were compared between intervention and control groups. Results: Seventy six medical students (28 male, 48 female) were participated in this study. Total score among intervention group was higher than control group (78.2\% vs. 72.5\%, p {$<$} 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed significant differences between scores of students in the intervention group and scores of students in the control group in the diagnostic section of questions (81.0\% vs. 71.5\%, P {$<$} 0.001). The scores of students in the intervention group were also significantly higher than control group in physiopathology section of questions. No statistically significant difference was discovered between two groups in scores of answers to treatment section of questions (78.1 (7.3) vs. 72.5 (5.5) P = 0.03). Conclusion: The results of the study showed that concept mapping method was more successful in education of evidence-based educated topic via CATs in comparison with lecture-based method. Interpretation of this finding would be the concept mapping method may develop meaningful learning among medical students.},

The purpose of this study is to introduce concept maps with clinical cases (the innovative program) to improve learning of biochemistry course content. Methods: Participants were first year medical students (n 0150) from Saveetha Medical College and Hospital (India); they were randomly divided into two groups of 75, one group attending the traditional program, the other the innovative program. Student performance was measured using three written knowledge tests (each with a maximum score of 20). The students also evaluated the relevance of the learning process using a 12-item questionnaire. Results: Students in the innovative program using concept mapping outperformed those in the traditional didactic program (means of 7.13Á8.28 vs. 12.33Á13.93, p B0.001). The students gave high positive ratings for the innovative course (93Á100\% agreement). Conclusion: The new concept-mapping program resulted in higher academic performance compared to the traditional course and was perceived favorably by the students. They especially valued the use of concept mapping as learning tools to foster the relevance of biochemistry to clinical practice, and to enhance their reasoning and learning skills, as well as their deeper understanding for biochemistry.},

The three concept mapping strategies were concept identifying, proposition identifying and student generated concept mapping. The instructional material was a 2000-word expository text related to the physiology and functioning of the human heart. Instruction was presented in a web based environment. Achievement was measured by three individual and a total criterion test. 105 college levels students were randomly assigned to one of four instructional treatments. Criterion tests were administered immediately after students interacted with their respective treatments. One-way analysis of variance indicated that (a.) specific concept mapping strategies can significantly improve student achievement of specific types of educational objectives and (b) all types of concept mapping strategies are not equally effective in facilitating student achievement.
