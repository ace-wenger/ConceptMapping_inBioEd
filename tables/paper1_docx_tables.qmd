abstract: "Concept mapping (CM) instructional interventions have substantial positive effects, according to several meta-analyses. 
However, these meta-analyses found significant heterogeneity in effect sizes (ES), but do not apply best methods for investigating it. 
The current study assessed and investigated the heterogeneity of 92 ES from 44 experimental or quasi-experimental studies of CM in biology education using multilevel meta-regression models. 
Ten variables were collected and categorized as extrinsic, methodological, sample, or intervention characteristics. 
Considered as a whole, ES were very heterogeneous (95% PI [-1.04, 2.03], I2 = 90.3%) with a mean ES of 0.50 (95% CI [0.26, 0.73]). 
Extrinsic and methodological characteristics (especially comparison condition) explained about 35% of within- and between-study variance.
Conclusion: Some constructivist predictions are supported (e.g., importance of integrated classrooms), while others are not (e.g., CM study by students is more effective than CM construction).
Research on CM efficacy in biology education is largely inconclusive; future research ought to focus on replication and generalization of previous findings."
